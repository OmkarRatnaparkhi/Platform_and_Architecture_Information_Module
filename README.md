# Platform_and_Architecture_Information_Module
- This application gives information of platform(OS) and architecture(processor) of machine.
- For running this application psutil should be installed.
- psutil (process and system utilities) is a cross-platform library for retrieving information on running processes and system utilization (CPU, memory, disks, network, sensors) in Python.

- Psutil is a Python cross-platform library used to access system details and process utilities. 
- It is used to keep track of various resources utilization in the system. 
- Usage of resources like CPU, memory, disks, network, sensors can be monitored. 
- Hence, this library is used for system monitoring, profiling, limiting process resources and the management of running processes. 
- It is supported in Python versions 2.6, 2.7 and 3.4+.
- To install pip use command : python -m pip install psutil
